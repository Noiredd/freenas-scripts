### freenas-scripts

My collection of scripts to automate my [FreeNAS](http://www.freenas.org) server.

Each folder is a separate subsystem - refer to the individual readmes for help.

I haven't built *all* of this code myself - parts have been adapted or straight up copied from various sources online.
I will try to add credit where necessary.
Until then, it's released under the MIT license.
